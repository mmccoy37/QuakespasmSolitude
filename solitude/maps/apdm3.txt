Thanks to:
	-Bengt and Tyrann for their brilliant compile tools.
	-The Func_msgboard and #terrafusion gang for all their help over the years.
	-id Software for Quake.
	-Ben Morris for Worldcraft 1.6a and Mike Jackman for TexMex.
	-All those who still play Quake 10 years on. You have good taste :)
	-Martin "Killer" Kilcoyne for working with me on KT-imPAKt for Q2, for
		which I released the original version of this map.



Installation
------------
Copy the file APDM3.bsp to your Quake/ID1/maps directory, then run the game and type
"map DM3RMX" at the console to load the map. If you want to play it in deathmatch, you
need to activate deathmatch mode first. If you don't know how, read the Quake manual.


Compatibility
-------------
This level has been fully tested with FitzQuake (by Metlslime) and unmodified WinQuake.
However, I am almost certain there will not be any problems loading it in other engines 
as it is a very simple level.

Here are links to some good GL engines to use for playing Quake.

LEVEL INFORMATION
=================

This is a remake of KTDM4 - Pretend Best Friend, which was a tiny deathmatch level I
made for the KT-imPAKt map pack for Quake 2. Since I had a gap in my Quake DM levels
I thought I would fill it up with something and this seemed like the ideal candidate
because I had the source map and the original was small. I thought it would be a 
quick conversion and would be dm only.

However, as I started converting the map, I realised that the brushwork of the original
map was pretty horrible and needed a lot of tidying up. Also, the tech themed architecture
designed for Quake 2 did not fit with Quake, so I decided to rebuild most of it.

Whilst the conversion didn't take me a huge amount of time (just a few days or so), it
did take a little longer than I expected, though I have also added a single player mode
to the level too, as I thought nobody would bother if it was DM only. So now it's
basically an SP conversion of a DM level in the same vein as DM3RMX :)



Story
-----
Bernard the Quake Marine was fond of playing football in the courtyard in front of the
military base at which he was serving. He would always have a kick about with Dave and the
other Marines of the Maroon Legion after a mission to unwind. However, things had been
uneventful at the base for weeks, with nothing to do but scrub floors and polish boots.
Thankfully, all this downtime also afforded the Legion a lot of time to practise football
outside.

Despite Bernard's fondness for football, he was a terrible player. Not only was he always
selected last when the usual captains - Dave and Roger - were choosing the teams, but he
ALWAYS ended up in goal. The other marines would joke that he'd make a better goalpost than
goal keeper and that he was only in goal because he was the fattest and most likely to
stop a goal by accident but Bernard didn't care - he loved football.

One day after letting in a particularly embarrassing shot from Roger, Bernard was searching
for the football. It had rolled off somewhere behind the rocket launchers they had propped
up as goalposts and dissapeared around the back of the toilets. Bernard was looking
hard but he couldn't see it. It was dark, smelly and wet around there. He knew that when
he found the ball it would probably be covered in piss and be all stinky. Although he
Bernard would have to pick the ball up to retrieve it, he was also a little excited at the
prospect of handing it to Dave for the centre kick - Dave's punishment for choosing Bernard
last again.

Bernard could not find the ball, but he spotted an open manhole. "what's this?" he wondered.
Bernard thought the ball must have rolled down into the hole so he decided to climb down and
get it. Although there was a sewer below, he was pretty sure he would find the ball floating
near the bottom of the ladder down because the sewers were never cleaned out - there would
be no current to take the ball away.

As Bernard clambered down the ladder, he heard a creak, felt a jolt and then plummeted 20
feet down into a pool of shit. He found the ball where he expected, but now he was trapped,
with no obvious way out other than to explore the strange little sewer that lay before him
and find another exit. "Lucky I'm carrying my axe, shotgun and 25 shells," bernard thought.
"it always comes in handy to have some basic survival equipment in this sort of situation".
